# Project Euler Solutions

Solutions to the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) problems I've tried.

My solutions are based on the [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler) variation of these questions, so they might differ slightly in format. The HackerRank problems tend to be more interesting, because they have a bunch of automated test cases, and most problems require the most efficient solution to the problem, because the tests timeout in 4 seconds.
